    <p>My name is Stephen Dillon Rice, however I've gone by Dillon my entire life.  I'm 28 years old and have recently finished my bachelors degree in general biology.  I wanted to pursue a career in the medical field but quickly realized that I could not afford to go, nor could I likely get in.  Instead I turned my attention towards programming.  I've dabbled with programming in the past and thought it was pretty neat, being able to create your own content.  I figured the bootcamp would be a great place to start on a career in it so I took the leap.  I'm a hard worker and a fast learner. If i'm interested in something then it's hard for me to not jump into the deep end.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Currently I work as a bartender and server at a local japanese restaurant called Kabuki.  I've worked there for almost nine years.  It is really the only job I've had as an adult.</p>
